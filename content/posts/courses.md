A list of all university courses I followed. The courses at the UvA all were 6
[EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System),
while the courses at UU were 7.5 EC. This are the main topics of my academic
studies:
- **Logic**: e.g. predicate logic and computational logic.
- **Maths**: e.g. calculus, Bayesian statistics and linear algebra.
- **Language**: e.g. language theory and speech and dialogue processing.
- **Programming**: e.g. web programming, datastructures and algorithms,
  low-level coding, and numerous programming languages.
- **ML**: e.g. neural nets in fields like natural language processing, computer
  vision, and search engines.
- **Ethics**: e.g. computational debiasing, sensitive data and philosophy of
  AI.
