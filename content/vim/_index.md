# Vim's Interesting Modifications (VIM)

Hi everyone! I'm Yochem and I like to use a little editor called _Vim_. I don't
know exactly anymore how and when I heard of Vim, but since the moment I
started with VimTutor I loved it. The way Vim makes a game out of editing text,
and the ultimate efficiency that it provides for just doing that, is amazing.

Nowadays, I use Neovim instead of Vim. It is more modern and removes a lot of
Vim's baggage. Also, I like using Lua for configuration a lot more than
VimScript ;).

On this blog, I will post small (Neo)Vim tips that might be of interest to
others. Chances are that I did not come up with the provided code snippets or
ideas. If you see something that should be credited to others, [let me
know]({{<ref contact >}}).
