## About

Hi! I'm Yochem. A Dutch student, currently in my second year of the research
master in artificial intelligence at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl).

I like programming, especially in Python, C, and Lua. I also really like
software that is lightweight and does one thing very well. Big
([Neo](https://github.com/neovim/neovim))[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))
enthousiast.
